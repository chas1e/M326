Thank you so much for allowing me to hand in late, you have no idea how much it has helped me. I'm positive on achieving my goal of ameliorating my discipline and organisation skills. In this folder you will find the documentation and the project folder, in the project folder you will find my hotel managment system. 

Quick summary
The application allows the user to log-in, register and go trough the motions of a normal customer. Everything for normal use is in place. The menus for both owner and staff weren’t added since it would’ve been a lot of work to prove the same point. I used the factory pattern for the menus and the implementation of the project is almost identical to what it was planned as. The whole menu part got a bit complicated and nerve-wrecking after a certain amount of time. I added special features and even menus for staff/owner but at some point, I had to stop. I settled for the entire customer experience. If rooms and amenities would be added the entire thing would work. Login and register service are securely handled with sha-256 encyption.
